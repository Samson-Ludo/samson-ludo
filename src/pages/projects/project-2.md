CCN takes the use of technology in teaching to a new level. From the professor's material, it produces integrated class notes, practice materials, homework, quizzes and tests. In collaboration with other developers and professors, I built several lecture and practice modules for MATH142 used in Olympic university and PHY110 used in University of Limerick during my internship with Loss of Generality (LoG).
